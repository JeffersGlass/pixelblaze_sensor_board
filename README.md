#Pixelblaze Sensor Expansion Board

For sale on Tindie!

I hope you find this useful or interesting. Maybe you hack your board? I'd be stoked to hear about it! Roll your own? Great!

Shout out to Sparkfun, their boards were used in the initial prototype, and their Eagle files were really helpful!

Shout out to [https://github.com/pyrohaz/STM32F0-PCD8544GraphicAnalyzer](https://github.com/pyrohaz/STM32F0-PCD8544GraphicAnalyzer) which is similar, even shares the fixed point FFT in common.
